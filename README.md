# Spam Detection with Naive Bayes

Classification project to detect spam messages using the Naive Bayes algorithm.

## How to run the project:
- acess here: https://spamdetector-sbpb5trqdmxysyeum8m9ev.streamlit.app/

## Results and analysis:
- Using the metrics of precision, f1 score, recall and accuracy, I realized that the best model was **Naive Bayes.**

## Main technologies:
- ### Python:
- Pandas, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, Streamlit.

## Model Used
- Algorithm: Naive Bayes
- Validation: Precision score, f1 score, recall score and accuracy score.
